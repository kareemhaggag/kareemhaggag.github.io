  (with Stephen B. Billings & Eric Chyn)<br />
  NBER Working Paper #27302<br />
  Conditionally Accepted at **American Economic Review: Insights**

   <blockquote><p align="left"> How do early-life experiences shape political identity? In this paper, we study how the end of race-based busing in Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools---an event that led to large changes in school racial composition---affected the party affiliations of those children in adulthood. Consistent with the contact hypothesis, we find that a 10-percentage point increase in the share of minorities in a white student's assigned school decreased their likelihood of registering as a Republican by 2 percentage points (12 percent). Overall, our results suggest that schools in childhood play an important role in shaping partisanship.</p> </blockquote>

   <blockquote>
   <p align="left"> Equal access to voting is a core feature of democratic government. Using data from millions of smartphone users, we quantify a racial disparity in voting wait times across a nationwide sample of polling places during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Relative to entirely-white neighborhoods, residents of entirely-black neighborhoods waited 29% longer to vote and were 74% more likely to spend more than 30 minutes at their polling place. This disparity holds when comparing predominantly white and black polling places within the same states and counties, and survives numerous robustness and placebo tests. We shed light on the mechanism for these results and discuss how geospatial data can be an effective tool to both measure and monitor these disparities going forward.<br></p> </blockquote>

   <blockquote><p align="left"> How does one's childhood neighborhood shape political engagement later in life? We leverage a natural experiment that moved children out of disadvantaged neighborhoods to study effects on their voting behavior more than a decade later. Using linked administrative data, we find that children who were displaced by public housing demolitions and moved using housing vouchers are 12 percent (3.3 percentage points) more likely to vote in adulthood, relative to their non-displaced peers. We argue that this result is unlikely to be driven by changes in incarceration or in their parents' outcomes, but rather by improvements in education and labor market outcomes, and perhaps by socialization. These results suggest that, in addition to reducing economic inequality, housing assistance programs that improve one's childhood neighborhood may be a useful tool in reducing inequality in political participation.</p> </blockquote>

* [Attribution Bias in Major Decisions: Evidence from the United States Military Academy](/f/Attribution_Bias_USMA.pdf) (June 2019)<br />
  (with Richard W. Patterson, Nolan G. Pope, & Aaron Feudo)<br />
  Revise & Resubmit at **Journal of Public Economics**

   <blockquote>
   <p align="left"> Using administrative data, we study the role of attribution bias in a high-stakes, consequential decision: the choice of a college major. Specifically, we examine the influence of fatigue experienced during exposure to a general education course on whether students choose the major corresponding to that course. To do so, we exploit the conditional random assignment of student course schedules at the United States Military Academy. We find that students who are assigned to an early morning (7:30 AM) section of a general education course are roughly 10% less likely to major in that subject, relative to students assigned to a later time slot for the course. We find similar effects for fatigue generated by having one or more back-to-back courses immediately prior to a general education course that starts later in the day. Finally, we demonstrate that the pattern of results is consistent with attribution bias and difficult to reconcile with competing explanations.<br></p> </blockquote>

* [Inaccurate Statistical Discrimination: An Identification Problem](/f/Inaccurate_Statistical_Discrimination.pdf) (July 2020)<br />
  (with J. Aislinn Bohren, Alex Imas, & Devin G. Pope)<br />
  NBER Working Paper #25935


   <details><summary> Abstract (+) </summary>
   
   <blockquote>
   <p align="left"> Discrimination---differential treatment by group identity---is widely studied in economics. Its source is often categorized as taste-based or statistical (belief-based)---a valuable distinction for policy design and welfare analysis. We argue that in many situations, individuals may have inaccurate beliefs about the relevant characteristics of different groups. This possibility creates an identification problem when isolating the source of discrimination. When not accounted for, we show both theoretically and experimentally that such \emph{inaccurate statistical discrimination} will be misclassified as taste-based. A review of the empirical discrimination literature in economics reveals the scope of this issue: a small minority of papers---fewer than 7\%---consider inaccurate beliefs. We then examine two alternative methodologies for differentiating between these three sources of discrimination---varying the amount of information presented to evaluators and eliciting evaluators' beliefs. We propose a possible intervention: when presented with accurate information, we show that inaccurate statistical discrimination decreases.<br></p> </blockquote>

   <blockquote>
   <p align="left"> When judging the value of a good, people may be overly influenced by the state in which they previously consumed it. For example, someone who tries out a new restaurant while very hungry may subsequently rate it as high quality, even if the food is mediocre. We produce a simple framework for this form of attribution bias that embeds a standard model of decision making as a special case. We test for attribution bias across two consumer decisions. First, we conduct an experiment in which we randomly manipulate the thirst of participants prior to consuming a new drink. Second, using data from thousands of amusement park visitors, we explore how pleasant weather during their most recent trip affects their stated and actual likelihood of returning. In both of these domains, we find evidence that people misattribute the influence of a temporary state to a stable quality of the consumption good. We provide evidence against several alternative accounts for our findings and discuss the broader implications of attribution bias in economic decision making.<br></p> </blockquote>

   <blockquote>
   <p align="left"> We study learning by doing (LBD) by New York City taxi drivers, who have substantial discretion over their driving strategies and receive compensation closely tied to their success in finding customers. In addition to documenting significant learning by these entrepreneurial agents, we exploit our data’s breadth to investigate the factors that contribute to driver improvement across a variety of situations. New drivers lag farther behind experienced drivers when in difficult situations. Drivers benefit from accumulating neighborhood-specific experience, which affects how they search for their next customers.<br></p> </blockquote>
