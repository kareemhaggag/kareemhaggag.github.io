## Working Papers

**[Attribution Bias in Consumer Choice](/f/Attribution_Bias)** (May 2016)<br />
 Kareem Haggag, Devin Pope<br />

>Abstract: We examine the role of defaults in high-frequency, small-scale choices using unique data on over 13 million NYC taxi rides. We exploit a shift in the set of default tip suggestions presented to customers prior to payment, as the base fare changes from below $15 to above $15. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that default suggestions have a large impact on tip amounts. These results are supported by a secondary analysis that uses the quasi-random assignment of customers to different cars to examine default effects on all fares above $15. Finally, we highlight a potential cost of setting defaults too high, as a higher proportion of customers opt to leave no credit card tip when presented with the higher suggested amounts.

## Publications

**[Learning by Driving: Productivity Improvements by New York City Taxi Drivers](/f/LBD.pdf)** (January 2017)<br />
 Kareem Haggag, Brian McManus, Giovanni Paci<br />
 **American Economic Journal: Applied Economics**, 9(1), 70-95. 2017

>Abstract: We study learning by doing (LBD) by New York City taxi drivers, who have substantial discretion over their driving strategies and receive compensation closely tied to their success in finding customers. In addition to documenting significant learning by these entrepreneurial agents, we exploit our dataâ€™s breadth to investigate the factors that contribute to driver improvement across a variety of situations. New drivers lag farther behind experienced drivers when in difficult situations. Drivers benefit from accumulating neighborhood-specific experience, which affects how they search for their next customers.


**[Default Tips](/f/Default_Tips.pdf)** (April 2014)<br />
 Kareem Haggag, Giovanni Paci<br />
 **American Economic Journal: Applied Economics**, 6(3), 1-19. 2014
