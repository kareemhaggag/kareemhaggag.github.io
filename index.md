I am an Associate Professor at the [UCLA Anderson School of Management] and a Faculty Research Fellow at the [National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)]. My [research] spans topics at the intersections of economics, psychology, and political science. 

Prior to joining the UCLA faculty, I was an assistant professor at [Carnegie Mellon University], a postdoctoral fellow with the [Financial Inclusion Program] at Yale University/Innovations for Poverty Action, and received my PhD in economics from the [University of Chicago Booth School of Business]. See my [CV] for more.
